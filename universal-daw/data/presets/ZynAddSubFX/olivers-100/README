   This is Oliver's hundred, a bank of patch files for ZynAddSubFX.
There are two bonus combination patches provided as parameter files.
I strongly encourage you to adapt these sounds to your own use and
to share your creations.

Important: many of these sounds have directions which you may view by
selecting "Edit instrument" from the advanced user interface window.
Many of the lead instruments have a vibrato effect controlled by the
modulation wheel.  Setting the modulation to zero gives a steady tone,
but a newly initialized voice assumes the modulation wheel is at 64.

Wishing you well with your musical endeavors,
Christopher Oliver
