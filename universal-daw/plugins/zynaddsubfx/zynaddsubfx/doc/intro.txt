Getting Started
---------------

ZynAddSubFX is a fairly complex software synthesizer with a very large number of
controls.
As such, it is not alway obvious how to use ZynAddSubFX.

Many applications under Linux transport MIDI over ALSA and transmit audio over
JACK.
ZynAddSubFX can be run in this configuration by running:

------------------------------
zynaddsubfx -I alsa -O jack -a
------------------------------

This sets the input driver to be alsa and the output driver to be jack, which
should attempt to autoconnect to your soundcard as per the '-a' flag.
If this is your first time running ZynAddSubFX, you will see a screen that lets
you choose between the advanced and beginner interface.
Currently the beginner interface is deprecated, so the advanced one is
recommended.

Now you should be able to see ZynAddSubFX's main window, from which you can
setup patches, effects, and general configurations, but more importatnly it
provides links into the parameters of the patches.
ZynAddSubFX is a powerful tool with a number of base patches, but its true power
lies in the ability to make your own patches.

.Main Window

For basic usage, you will want to use the button to the right of the enabled
label.
This button will allow for one to select the desired instrument from the banks
that ZynAddSubFX has available.
To play notes in ZynAddSubFX, either utilize the builtin virtual keyboard
(accessible via the vK button) or connect your keyboard to the system and use
*aconnect* to connect it to ZynAddSubFX (assuming that ALSA was used).

This main window provides access to a number of more advanced features.
Some of these features are:

* System Effects
* Insertion Effects
* Recording
* Part Settings (instrument level settings)
* Master Settings
* Microtonal Settings

For instance to use the recording feature, a wave file must be selected from the
recording menu and then the recording can be started with the record button and
stopped with the stop button.
This is a simple and quick way of recording some samples from ZynAddSubFX,
though there are more full featured options available via JACK recording tools.

NOTE: After hitting record, the wave file will not start recording until a new
key has been pressed via either an external midi source or the virtual keyboard
Both system and insertion effects can be accessed, the properties are available as well as properties of each
instrument.
