-------------------------------

Usually there are several methods to obtain a copy of ZynAddSubFX.

SourceForge::
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/zynaddsubfx/files/
Distribuition::
    apt/yum/others
Git::
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/zynaddsubfx/code zynaddsubfx

Introduction to Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those who want to live on the bleeding edge or who want to assist with
making sure that the next release has fewer bugs, you will want to get aquanted
with git.
Git is used to manage the source code for this project and can be used to
quickly and easily get an up-to-date copy of the source code.

Getting the Source Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to get a copy of the ZynAddSubFX source code, all that needs to be done is:

---------------------------------------------
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/zynaddsubfx/code zynaddsubfx

cd zynaddsubfx

#Download additional resources
git submodule init
git submodule update
---------------------------------------------

You should now be in the directory of the source code.

For simple steps on building, please see Appendix B of the manual.

Checking out a branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lets say that development has extended into the creation of a new feature that
you want to preview.
For the sake of this guide, lets assume that the name of the branch that the
feature is on is foo.

-----------------------------------------
#checkout the foo branch from sourceforge
git checkout --track -b foo origin/foo

#lets checkout the primary branch again
git checkout master

#hop back to the other branch
git checkout foo
----------------------------------------

Now one should be able to change branches and go into the build directory (as
described in Appendix B) and recompile ZynAddSubFX.

NOTE: When using branches other than the master be aware that stability may
      suffer
