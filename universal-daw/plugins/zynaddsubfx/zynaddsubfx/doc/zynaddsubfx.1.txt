NAME
----
zynaddsubfx - a software synthesizer

SYNOPSIS
--------
*zynaddsubfx* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*zynaddsubfx* is a polyphonic multimbral synthesizer, which supports three
synthesis engines and numerous effects to generate sound.

1) ADsynth generates sounds by adding a number of voices.
   Each voice has filters, envelopes, LFOs, morphing, modulation
   (Ring Modulation, Phase Modulation... the modulators can have any
   shape), resonance, etc...
   Each voice includes a waveform generator with up to 128 sine/non-sine
   harmonics.
   You can use Fourier synthesis or if you don't like it you
   can wave-shaping/filtering of functions.

2) SUBsynth is a simple engine which makes sounds through
   harmonic filtering of white noise

3) PADsynth is an engine that makes very beautiful pads and other instruments,
   which can be exported for use with other programs.

Midi and audio support exists for OSS, ALSA, JACK, and others...
