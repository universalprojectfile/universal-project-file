	Frequently Asked Questions
	--------------------------

Q1) What means "ZynAddSubFX" ?
A1) The name of the program comes from 4 words:
    1) Synthesizer ('S'->'Z') --> Zyn
       ^^^
    2) Additive Synthesis ------> Add
       ^^^
    3) Subtractive Synthesis ---> Sub
       ^^^
    4) Effects  ----------------> FX 
    
    So, ZynAddSubFX is a SYNthesizer with ADDitive, SUBtractive engines and effects.
        

Q2) How can I load files from older versions of ZynAddSubFX (like *.mas_zyn,etc)
A2) You need to convert them into new format. Please use 2.0.0pre1 or (recommended) 2.0.0pre2 versions of ZynAddSubFX to load old file formants and save them in the new formats


Q3) How can I change the number of parts, voices to ADSynth, effects, etc. ?
A3) Look in src/globals.h and change there these values. You don't have to change anything else, just recompile all. But most settings must be below 128. As the rule of the thumb if a setting is 128 or below 128, please don't make it bigger than 128. Anyway, I don't believe that you'll need more than 128 for these settings; for example you don't need 128(or more) effects same time? That's why I put the limit of 128 (using 7 bits of char).


Q4) How do I enable Jack support on ZynAddSubFX ?
A4) If your system has the jack libraries installed, ZynAddSubFX should automatically build with jack support. It is highly recommended that the Jack samplerate to be equal to ZynAddSubFX samplerate (SAMPLE_RATE from globals.h), otherwise the resampling will be done and this will decrease the quality a bit.
